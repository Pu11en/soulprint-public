## Landing Page Prompt

Build a SoulPrint landing page with these requirements:

### MISSION:
"Your best friend isn't in your contacts — yet."

SoulPrint gives you an AI with its own identity. It learns who you are through a personality assessment, then becomes someone who actually knows you. It remembers everything. It acts on its own. It's not a chatbot — it's a digital companion that gets shit done.

### HERO SECTION:
- Headline: "Your Best Friend Isn't In Your Contacts"
- Subhead: "Meet your AI with a soul. It knows you. It remembers you. It works for you."
- CTA: "Join the Waitlist" (capture email)
- Visual: Phone showing Telegram/SMS conversation with the AI being personal and useful

### THE VISION (Mission Section):
We believe AI should know you like a friend — not just answer questions like a search engine. SoulPrint creates an AI identity from a simple assessment, then builds a relationship over time. It remembers your goals, your preferences, your history. It acts on your behalf. It grows with you.

### WHAT IT CAN DO (Complex Capabilities):
1. "Scout me plumbers in Austin" → Finds 50 businesses, scores them by opportunity, ranks the ones bleeding money
2. "Build demo sites for my top leads" → Generates custom websites, deploys them live, creates UGC videos with AI voiceover
3. "Prep me for a call with Joe's Plumbing" → Pulls all intel, writes objection responses, suggests pricing
4. "Design me a mobile app for my business" → Uses Google Stitch to generate actual UI screens
5. "Remember that I hate morning meetings" → Saves to memory, references it forever

### ADD YOUR OWN TOOLS:
SoulPrint can learn new capabilities. Using open-source code from GitHub, your AI can build custom tools for your specific needs.

### CHANNELS:
- Telegram (now)
- SMS (coming)
- Your own dedicated number
- Web app

### WAITLIST CTA:
"Be the first to meet your SoulPrint. Join the waitlist."

### VIBE:
Premium, personal, futuristic but warm. Not corporate. Not robotic. Dark mode, clean, bold typography, subtle animations.
